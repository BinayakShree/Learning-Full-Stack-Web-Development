# Full Stack Web Development Journey - Week 1

Welcome to my journey of learning Full Stack Web Development! This repository documents what I learned in week 1.

## Week 1: JavaScript Essentials

### Topics Covered:
- **JavaScript Loops**: `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...in`, `for...of`
- **Functions**: Declarations, expressions, arrow functions, IIFE
- **Callbacks**: Synchronous and asynchronous
- **Promises**: Creation, consumption, chaining
- **Async/Await**: Converting promise-based code, error handling
- **Sync and Async Code**: Differences, event loop

### Reflections
This week, I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript, focusing on asynchronous operations and their importance in web development.

Stay tuned for more updates in the coming weeks!
