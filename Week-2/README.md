# Full Stack Web Development Journey - Week 2

Welcome back to my journey of learning Full Stack Web Development! This repository documents what I learned in week 2.

## Week 2: Advanced JavaScript & Express Basics

### Topics Covered:
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Deep dive into callbacks, promises, and async/await
- **Express**: Introduction to Express.js, setting up a basic server
- **HTTP Communication**: Understanding the basics of HTTP, including methods, status codes, and headers
- **Assignments**: Solved various exercises to solidify understanding of asynchronous JavaScript & Express

### Reflections
This week, I delved deeper into asynchronous JavaScript, which is crucial for handling operations like API requests and I/O tasks in web development. Additionally, I started learning about Express.js, a powerful Node.js framework for building web servers, and gained a theoretical understanding of HTTP communication, which is the foundation of data exchange on the web.

Stay tuned for more updates in the coming weeks!
